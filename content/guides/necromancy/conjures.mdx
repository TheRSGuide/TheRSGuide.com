title: Necromancy Conjures
description: Summon powerful undead allies to aid you in combat
---

Necromancy has **4 Conjures**, all of which are unique to **Necromancy**. You will need **Ectoplasm** with you to conjure these.

These can be **Conjured**, dealing small amounts of damage to your target whilst conjured, as well as apply any effects they may have.

Each conjure can also be **Commanded**, allowing additional attacks or effects to apply.

Conjuring and Commanding cost a global cooldown, and are used just like normal abilities (but do not generate adrenaline).

Once a conjure has been cast, the ability will automatically turn into their respective Command ability, so the same action bar slot can be used for both actions. Conjures will last a base duration of **60s** and once despawned can be resummoned.

## ![Conjure Skeleton Warrior](https://runescape.wiki/images/Conjure_Skeleton_Warrior.png?b6988) Conjure Skeleton Warrior

This conjure will deal **25%** average damage to your target every **3s**. Each attack will apply a **Rage** stack, increasing the average damage by **3%** per stack, up to a maximum of **25** stacks. These will be reset when your **Skeleton Warrior** despawns.

### ![Command Skeleton Warrior](https://runescape.wiki/images/Command_Skeleton_Warrior.png?a0755) Command Skeleton Warrior

When commanded, attack speed is significantly increased, dealing **25%** average damage every **1.2s**. This effect lasts for **6s** and has a **15s cooldown**. Each attack will still apply, and benefit from **Rage** stacks.

## ![Conjure Putrid Zombie](https://runescape.wiki/images/Conjure_Putrid_Zombie.png?dee5d) Conjure Putrid Zombie

This conjure will deal **20%** average damage to your target every **3.6s**. This conjure will also deal **10% Poison** damage every **1.8s** to any enemies within 1 tile of itself.

It is important to note that conjuring the zombie has a **30s cooldown**.

### ![Command Putrid Zombie](https://runescape.wiki/images/Command_Putrid_Zombie.png?e4674) Command Putrid Zombie

When this conjure is **Commanded**, it will explode, dealing **400%** average damage to all enemies within **2 tiles** of the zombie, despawning the Zombie. A new one will need to be summoned.

## ![Conjure Vengeful Ghost](https://runescape.wiki/images/Conjure_Vengeful_Ghost.png?50d9d) Conjure Vengeful Ghost

This conjure will deal **20%** average damage to your target every **4.2s**. More importantly, this conjure will also heal you for **140%** of the conjure's damage dealt.

### ![Command Vengeful Ghost](https://runescape.wiki/images/Command_Vengeful_Ghost.png?0a32b) Command Vengeful Ghost

When this conjure is **Commanded**, each attack will apply **Haunted** to your target. This will only last for a short amount of time, but while your ghost is hitting your target, it will upkeep the buff.

When a target is **Haunted** it will take up to **10% bonus damage** from all attacks from any player attacking the target. This does have a cap, so abilities that deal a single high hit will benefit less from this boost.

## ![Conjure Phantom Guardian](https://runescape.wiki/images/Conjure_Phantom_Guardian.png?74453) Conjure Phantom Guardian

This conjure does not directly deal any damage to your target. Instead, this **reduces incoming damage by 5%**. Similar to the **Vengeful Ghost**, this reduction has a cap, so it is more powerful against multiple smaller hits. This reduction does not apply to typeless damage. All hits that are reduced will generate a **Valour** stack, up to a maximum of **25**.

### ![Command Phantom Guardian](https://runescape.wiki/images/Command_Phantom_Guardian.png?8ee22) Command Phantom Guardian

When this conjure is **Commanded**, it will deal an attack of average **50%** damage to your target and up to 4 enemies within 1 tile of your target. This damage will be increased by an average of **10%** for each **Valour** stack increasing the damage to a max of **300%** damage at 25 stacks.

## ![Conjure Undead Army](https://runescape.wiki/images/Conjure_Undead_Army.png?71c98) Conjure Undead Army

Finally, there is the **Conjure Undead Army** ability. This can be customised to allow you to conjure multiple conjures with a single ability. This does consume **2x Ectoplasm** for each conjure.
