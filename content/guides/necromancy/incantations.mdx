title: Necromancy Incantations
description: Powerful spells that require Necromancy runes to cast
---

Incantations are very similar to spells, as they require **Necromancy** runes to cast. Unlike spells, these all cost a global cooldown to cast, just like a conventional ability.

### ![Bone Shield](https://runescape.wiki/images/Lesser_Bone_Shield_icon.png?79e73) Bone Shield

This allows you to use defensive abilities that normally require a shield, without a shield equipped. This can be toggled on, and defensives can be used as needed, automatically costing runes.

### ![Threads of Fate](https://runescape.wiki/images/Threads_of_Fate_icon.png?a46d9) Threads of Fate

When cast this will grant you a buff for **6.6s**. During this effect all *single-target* Necromancy abilities will be cast on up to 4 additional targets, within **4 tiles** of your main target. This has a **45s cooldown**.

---

### ![Life Transfer](https://runescape.wiki/images/Life_Transfer_icon.png?16c3c) Life Transfer

When cast this will extend the duration of your active conjures by **21s**, and damaging yourself for **50%** of your base lifepoints. This has a **45s cooldown**.

---

### ![Invoke Death](https://runescape.wiki/images/Invoke_Death_icon.png?2dc4c) Invoke Death

When cast this will provide you a buff for **12s**, causing your next necromancy ability to apply **Death Mark** to any target hit. When a necromancy ability damages your target below either **30,000 LP**, or **20%** of their total lifepoints, whichever is **lower**, the target will be instantly killed.

### ![Darkness](https://runescape.wiki/images/Darkness_icon.png?9f2fd) Darkness

When cast this will apply **Darkness** to your character for **12 minutes**. This will provide you with a **20% chance to dodge** incoming attacks. This buff works while using any combat style.

### ![Split Soul](https://runescape.wiki/images/Split_Soul_icon.png?648e6) Split Soul

When cast this will apply a buff to your character for **20.4s**. During this time, and while using the **Soul Split** curse, Soul Split will no longer heal you. Instead, **40%** of the health you would have healed, is dealt as additional damage. This has diminishing returns, the higher each single hit is.
