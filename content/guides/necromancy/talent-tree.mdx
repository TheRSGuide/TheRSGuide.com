title: Necromancy Talent Tree
description: Unlock and upgrade abilities through the Well of Souls
---

The **Talent Tree** is a resource for **Necromancy**, to unlock and upgrade abilities, incantations, and other passives. It can be accessed using the **Well of Souls**, located near the **City of Um Ritual Site**. A large amount of the abilities and incantations mentioned earlier in this guide are unlocked via the talent tree.

Each talent can be unlocked using a **Talent Point**, a currency that is obtained while gaining necromancy xp through combat. Each tier of talents will also have requirements to unlock such as necromancy level, quests or an amount of **Souls**, a currency from completing rituals.

> **Note:** Once you unlock a talent, it remains active. You do not have to juggle available talents.
