title: Necromancy Abilities
description: Core abilities and the stack system unique to Necromancy
---

**Necromancy** features a set of core abilities as well as [Conjures](/guides/necromancy/conjures) and [Incantations](/guides/necromancy/incantations). It also has a stack system which will be heavily used when forming rotations and utilizing abilities.

There are no threshold abilities like the other three styles; instead, Necromancy has abilities that cost adrenaline and/or stacks. You'll also notice that some of these abilities don't have a cooldown.

> **Note:** This page will explain core abilities. [Conjures](/guides/necromancy/conjures) and [Incantations](/guides/necromancy/incantations) will be explained in their respective pages.

## Basic Attack

### ![Necromancy](https://runescape.wiki/images/Necromancy.png?8464e) Necromancy

Necromancy is the only style that has a **Basic Attack**. It can be toggled on and is effectively a basic ability that will automatically be cast when you don't cast a different ability. The Basic Attack deals an average of **100%** damage and generates **9%** adrenaline. This is useful for generating adrenaline and can be a filler ability to press when other abilities are on cooldown.

## ![Necrosis](https://runescape.wiki/images/Necrosis.png?61b47) Necrosis Abilities

The first of the two stacks we're going to cover is called **Necrosis**. Stacks of Necrosis will appear on your buff bar and have a maximum cap of **12**.

Necrosis stacks can be built up and spent in a few different ways:

### ![Touch of Death](https://runescape.wiki/images/Touch_of_Death.png?9bded) Touch of Death

Touch of Death is a **basic ability** which has an average of **100% damage** and generates **9% adrenaline**. Unlike the Basic Attack, it has a cooldown and generates **4 Necrosis** stacks when used. Because of this, it is a better choice over Basic Attack when available.

---

### ![Finger of Death](https://runescape.wiki/images/Finger_of_Death.png?84e84) Finger of Death

Finger of Death is a powerful ability that deals an average of **300% damage** and costs **60% adrenaline** to cast. It does not have a cooldown, so the limiting factor to cast it is adrenaline.

The adrenaline cost for Finger of Death is **reduced by 10%** for each **Necrosis** stack you have. It can use a maximum of **6** stacks, resulting in an adrenaline cost of **0%**.

As an example, if you have **12 Necrosis** stacks, you can cast Finger of Death twice without using any adrenaline.

## Ultimate Abilities

Necromancy has two ultimate abilities:

### ![Death Skulls](https://runescape.wiki/images/Death_Skulls.png?8c821) Death Skulls

Casting Death Skulls will fire a flurry of skulls at your target, bouncing between targets and hitting up to **5 times**. This will cost **100%** adrenaline and deals an average of **250% damage per hit**. This ability has a **60s cooldown**.

- In **single target** scenarios, skulls will bounce back and forth between your character and your target, hitting your target **3 times** for a total of **750%** damage. This will not damage you.
- In **multi target** scenarios, skulls will bounce between additional targets and deal **5 hits** of damage for a total of **1,250%** damage between enemies.

> This ability can be upgraded by obtaining the [Igneous Kal-Mor](/guides/late-game/zuk-cape), reducing the adrenaline cost to **60%** and increasing the number of bounces by **2**.

### ![Living Death](https://runescape.wiki/images/Living_Death.png?7c2b7) Living Death

Living Death is an Ultimate ability applied to your character, not on a target. It transforms you into a *skeletal* character and lasts **30s** with a **90s cooldown**. Unlike other styles that have flat damage-boosting Ultimates, Living Death changes how four Necromancy abilities work while active:

- ![Necromancy](https://runescape.wiki/images/Necromancy.png?8464e) **Basic Attack:** Generates **2 Necrosis** stacks when cast.
- ![Touch of Death](https://runescape.wiki/images/Touch_of_Death.png?9bded) **Touch of Death:** Generates an extra 6% adrenaline for a total of **15%**.
- ![Finger of Death](https://runescape.wiki/images/Finger_of_Death.png?84e84) **Finger of Death:** Deals **50% more damage** for a total of **450% average damage**.
- ![Death Skulls](https://runescape.wiki/images/Death_Skulls.png?8c821) **Death Skulls:** Reduces the cooldown from **60s** to **12s**.

Additionally, when **Living Death** is cast, the cooldown of **Touch of Death** and **Death Skulls** are instantly reset.

As you can see, **Living Death** is focused on **Necrosis** stacks and provides benefits to gaining stacks as well as increased damage output when using them.

## ![Residual Soul](https://runescape.wiki/images/Residual_Soul.png?abe95) Soul Abilities

The second of our two stacks is called **Residual Souls**.

Stacks of Souls will appear on your buff bar and can be seen floating around your character. By default, you can have a maximum of **3**, but this can be increased to **5** with the **Soulbound Lantern**.

Souls can be built up and spent in a few different ways:

### ![Soul Sap](https://runescape.wiki/images/Soul_Sap.png?8c821) Soul Sap

Soul Sap is a **basic ability** which has an average of **100% damage** and generates **9% adrenaline**.

It generates **1 Soul** stack when used.

---

### ![Soul Strike](https://runescape.wiki/images/Soul_Strike.png?8c821) Soul Strike

Soul Strike does not cost or generate any adrenaline but costs **1 Soul** stack to use, dealing **150%** average damage to your target, while also **stunning** the target for 3s. This will also deal **100%** average damage to any targets within 1 tile of your main target.

---

### ![Volley of Souls](https://runescape.wiki/images/Volley_of_Souls.png?7c2b7) Volley of Souls

Volley of Souls also does not cost or gain any adrenaline, but it does cost **1 Soul** stack and requires a minimum of **2 Soul** stacks to cast.

When cast, it will consume all **Souls** and deal an average of **150%** damage per soul. This results in a total of **450%** average damage when cast with **3 Souls** and an average of **750%** when cast with **5 Souls**.

---

## Extra Abilities

Lastly, we have some final abilities to cover. These abilities are not **Soul** or **Necrosis** abilities.

### ![Bloat](https://runescape.wiki/images/Bloat.png?b6988) Bloat

Bloat is a damage over time ability. It costs **20% adrenaline** to use and doesn't have a cooldown.

This will deal an initial hit of **150%** damage, and apply a debuff to the target called **Bloated**. While the target is bloated it will take an average of **37.5%** damage every **1.8s** for a total of 10 hits over **19.8s**.

If your target dies while under the effects of bloated, the effect will spread to any enemies within 1 tile of the initial target. This will deal **4 bloated hits** to each afflicted target and can continuously repeat if those targets also die during the effect.

This ability is powerful in both AoE and single target situations. Over the full **19.8s**, **Bloat** will deal an average of **525%** damage to your primary target.

### ![Blood Siphon](https://runescape.wiki/images/Blood_Siphon.png?7c2b7) Blood Siphon

Blood Siphon is Necromancy's only **channelled ability**, which means it will take longer than a global cooldown to cast.

Blood Siphon deals **25%** average damage every 1.2s to targets within **2 tiles** of your character, but will **not** deal damage to your main target. Each time damage is dealt, your character will heal for **70%** of the damage dealt. The more targets hit by this ability, the higher the healing.

When you have channelled the entire ability, your character will hit your main target for **130%** average damage plus **100% of your total healing**. This can be both an effective ability for single-target damage and an effective way to heal at boss encounters with multiple enemies.

---

### ![Spectral Scythe](https://runescape.wiki/images/Spectral_Scythe.png?e16a3) Spectral Scythe

Spectral Scythe is an **Area of Effect** ability with a unique *multi-cast* mechanic.

When cast, the ability converts into a slightly more powerful version of itself, and when that is cast, it will convert to an even more powerful version. If not used for 15s, it will convert back to the base version. Spectral Scythe has a 15s cooldown, so the first cast in a *set* will always be the base version.

**Spectral Scythe (base):**

- **10% adrenaline** cost
- Each hit has a **25%** chance to generate **1 Soul** stack
