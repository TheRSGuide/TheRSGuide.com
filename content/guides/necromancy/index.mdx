**Necromancy** is the newest combat style, added in 2023. It is a modern spin on the classic styles, and was designed to be both more intuitive and less complex than other styles while offering a competitive power level. Necromancy is the most popular style for the majority of players due to its ease of use and low skill ceiling. It also offers the tools required to excel in a number of different combat scenarios.

Unlike the other three styles, Necromancy has a **talent tree** where various abilities and buffs can be unlocked.

The aim of this guide is to provide you with the information needed to fully understand how to utilize the Necromancy style, and not to share exact ability rotations to copy. It is much more effective to learn what the tools are and how to apply them instead of copying a preset rotation without any applied understanding.
