**Melee** is one of the **3 core styles**, thus following the general concept of **Basic**, **Threshold** and **Ultimate Abilities**. It is one of the most perilous, but rewarding combat styles to use and has a relatively high skill ceiling.

Melee has a large amount of abilities due to the **Attack** and **Strength** skills having their own ability books. All abilities in both books are still classed as Melee abilities and merely have different skill requirements to use. Because of this difference, crafting effective Melee rotations can be overwhelming as the options feel endless.
