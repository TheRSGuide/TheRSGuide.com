title: Melee Threshold Abilities
description: Powerful abilities that cost 15% adrenaline
---

Similar to the amount of basic abilities, Melee also has a large amount of thresholds compared to other styles. These vary massively in damage and situational usefulness.

As covered in [Combat Basics](/getting-started/combat-basics), all of these thresholds will require **50%** adrenaline to cast, and will cost **15%** adrenaline.

## Channelled Abilities

All abilities in this section are Channelled Abilities. This means they must be cast for longer than a **Global Cooldown (1.8s)** to deal their full damage. Remember to watch your channel bar mentioned in the [Buff Bar](/setup/buff-bar) section. Players **can** move during melee channelled abilities, as long as they remain within **attack range** of their target.

### ![Assault](https://runescape.wiki/images/Assault.png?47cfd) Assault

Assault is a high damaging channelled ability dealing **140%** damage per hit every **1.2s**. This ability hits **4 times** for a total channel time of **4.2s** and a total damage of **560%** with a cooldown of **30s**.

---

### ![Destroy](https://runescape.wiki/images/Destroy.png?cbe6b) Destroy

This ability behaves very similarly to Assault but has a **20.4s** cooldown. This deals **130%** damage per hit every **1.2s**, hitting **4 times** for a total channel time of **4.2s** and a total damage of **520%**. Additionally, the target will be **Stunned and Bound** for **3.6s**.

## Area of Effect

### ![Hurricane](https://runescape.wiki/images/Hurricane.png?cd190) Hurricane

Casting **Hurricane** spins you on the spot, dealing **135%** damage to your target. You will also deal a secondary hit of **150%** to your main target, and any additional targets within **1 tile** around you. This ability has a **20.4s** cooldown, can only be cast with a **2h** weapon, and shares a cooldown with **Destroy**.

### ![Quake](https://runescape.wiki/images/Quake.png?47cfd) Quake

Quake is our final **AoE** dealing **145%** damage to all targets within **1 tile** around your character with a cooldown of **20.4s**. This will also reduce the **defence** stat and increase your **hit chance** against all enemies damaged if below **100%** hit chance. Quake can only be cast with a **2h** weapon.

## Stuns

### ![Forceful Backhand](https://runescape.wiki/images/Forceful_Backhand.png?8c0bb) ![Stomp](https://runescape.wiki/images/Stomp.png?babc9) Forceful Backhand/Stomp

Forceful Backhand and Stomp are 2 separate abilities, but they are functionally the same and share a cooldown of **15s**. When cast they will deal a low amount of damage for a threshold at **130%**, but will **stun and bind** the target for **3.6s**.

## Bleeds

### ![Slaughter](https://runescape.wiki/images/Slaughter.png?8b456) Slaughter

**Slaughter** is a damage over time ability, dealing **35%** average damage per hit, hitting **5 times** over **6s**, with a cooldown of **30s**. If the target moves after the ability is cast, you will deal **3x damage** for an average damage of **105%** per hit. You are able to move most targets manually and if correctly done will lead to an increased damage total of **525%**.

### ![Blood Tendrils](https://runescape.wiki/images/Blood_Tendrils.png?d79a1) Blood Tendrils

> This ability is obtained via a codex after [The Dig Site](/guides/early-game/dig-site) quest.

**Blood Tendrils** deals an initial hit of **110%** with an additional **4 hits** of **55%** over the next **4.8s**. Blood Tendrils can be a dangerous ability though, as **27%** of the damage dealt from the 4 additional hits is dealt back to your player. This results in a total damage of **330%** and a cooldown of **45s**.
