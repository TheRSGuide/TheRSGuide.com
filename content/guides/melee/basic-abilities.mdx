### ![Barge](https://runescape.wiki/images/Barge.png?24119) Barge

Barge deals **85%** average damage with a cooldown of **20.4s**. When used on a target you will move to within 1 tile of that target, from up to 10 tiles away. Casting this will break you free from any binds, and will instead bind your target for **6.6s**.

> Can be upgraded to ![Greater Barge](https://runescape.wiki/images/Greater_Barge.png?2fe13) **Greater Barge** via an ability codex.
>
> The movement and bind effects remain the same. The base damage also remains the same, but additional damage will be dealt to your target the longer you are not attacking, up to a maximum of **6s**.
>
> Additionally, if you have not attacked for **4.8s**, when Greater Barge is cast you will receive a buff. This allows the first channelled ability used in the next **6s** to deal its full damage without the need to channel it, saving you time.

---

### ![Chaos Roar](https://runescape.wiki/images/Chaos_Roar.png?39da1) Chaos Roar

> This ability is obtained via a codex unlock.

Chaos Roar deals **95%** average damage and has a **60s** cooldown. When cast, your next melee ability within **7.2s** will deal double damage. Bear in mind that for Channelled Abilities, this will only boost the first hit.
