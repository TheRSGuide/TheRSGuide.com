description: Your most powerful abilities costing 100% adrenaline
---

Here we're going to cover 4 of Melee's Ultimate Abilities, all of which are very different from each other. The first two are strictly damage focused, while the latter two provide some utility benefits.

As covered in [Combat Basics](/getting-started/combat-basics), all of these Ultimates will cost **100%** adrenaline to cast unless stated otherwise.

### ![Berserk](https://runescape.wiki/images/Berserk.png?27b7b) Berserk

Berserk is an Ultimate that is cast on your character, empowering you for **19.8s** with a **60s** cooldown. During this time, all Melee attacks will deal **2x** damage, and you will take **50%** more damage.

Note that **bleed** abilities **do not** benefit from this buff, but Channelled Abilities augmented by Greater Barge do. The duration of this can be increased from **19.8s** to **25.8s** via certain high level armour.

### ![Overpower](https://runescape.wiki/images/Overpower.png?bba74) Overpower

When cast, you will deal **300%** average damage to your target, costing **100%** adrenaline with a **30s** cooldown.

> This ability can be upgraded by obtaining the [Igneous Kal-Ket](/guides/late-game/zuk-cape), reducing the adrenaline cost to **60%** and increasing the number of hits from **1** to **2**, for a total of **600%** average damage.

### ![Meteor Strike](https://runescape.wiki/images/Meteor_Strike.png?e1631) Meteor Strike

Meteor Strike can only be cast with a **2h**, dealing **300%** damage to all targets within **1 tile** of your character. You will also gain **8%** adrenaline from every **Critical Strike** for the next **30s**. Critical Strikes generated from the initial cast of Meteor Strike will generate adrenaline. This ability has a **60s** cooldown.

### ![Pulverise](https://runescape.wiki/images/Pulverise.png?9b9e7) Pulverise

This ability will perform a giant swing at your target, dealing **300%** average damage and applying **Pulverised** for **30s**. While the target is Pulverised it will deal **25%** less damage to all players. Instead, if your target dies to this ability, you will be granted **50%** adrenaline.
