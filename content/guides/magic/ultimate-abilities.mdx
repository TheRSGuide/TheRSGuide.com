### ![Sunshine](https://runescape.wiki/images/Sunshine.png?f2e63) Sunshine

Sunshine is an Ultimate that is cast around your location, empowering you for **30.6s** with a **60s** cooldown. This cooldown is shared with **Metamorphosis**. During this time, when standing inside your Sunshine, all Magic attacks are increased by **50%**.

Note that **bleed** abilities **do not** benefit from this buff.

> Can be upgraded to ![Greater Sunshine](https://runescape.wiki/images/Greater_Sunshine.png?ac8be) **Greater Sunshine** via an ability codex - increases duration from **30.6s** to **38.4s**.

### ![Metamorphosis](https://runescape.wiki/images/Metamorphosis.png?c68e3) Metamorphosis

Metamorphosis is an Ultimate that is cast on your character, increasing your damage by **66%** for **15s**, with a **60s** cooldown shared with **Sunshine**.

Unlike **Sunshine**, bleed abilities **do** benefit from this buff. It is worth noting that the damage increase only affects your **main** target.

### ![Tsunami](https://runescape.wiki/images/Tsunami.png?302d3) Tsunami

When cast, Tsunami will hit your target, and up to **8** additional targets in a frontal area to your player, for **250%** average damage. You will also gain **8%** adrenaline from every **Critical Strike** for the next **30s**. Critical Strikes generated from the initial cast of Tsunami will generate adrenaline. This ability has a **60s** cooldown.

When cast, you will deal **300%** average damage to your target, costing **100%** adrenaline with a **30s** cooldown.
