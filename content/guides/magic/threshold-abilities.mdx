Just like in the basic abilities section, **Magic** and **Range** tend to share a lot of similar feeling thresholds.

## 'Simple' Thresholds

### ![Wild Magic](https://runescape.wiki/images/Wild_Magic.png?74ce7) Wild Magic

Wild Magic deals **2** hits of **140%** average damage, for a total of **280%** with a **20.4s** cooldown.

## Channelled Abilities

All abilities in this section are Channelled Abilities. This means they must be cast for longer than a **Global Cooldown (1.8s)** to deal their full damage. Remember to watch your channel bar mentioned in the [Buff Bar](/setup/buff-bar) section. Players are **unable** to move during magic channelled abilities.

### ![Asphyxiate](https://runescape.wiki/images/Asphyxiate.png?3145c) Asphyxiate

Asphyxiate is a high damaging channelled ability dealing **120%** damage per hit every **1.2s**. This ability hits **4 times** for a total channel time of **4.2s** and a total damage of **480%** with a cooldown of **20.4s**. Additionally, the target will be **Stunned and Bound** for **3.6s**.

### ![Smoke Tendrils](https://runescape.wiki/images/Smoke_Tendrils.png?74ce7) Smoke Tendrils

> This ability is obtained via a codex after [The Dig Site](/guides/early-game/dig-site) quest.

Just like **Asphyxiate**, this is a channelled ability dealing **4 hits** with a total channel time of **4.2s**. Each hit deals progressively more damage, but importantly, each hit is guaranteed to **Critical Strike**. This means each hit will deal **1.5x damage** at level 90, leading to damage values per hit of **97.5%**, **120%**, **142.5%**, and **165%**, leading to a total average damage of **525%**. The cooldown is **45s**.

This ability will also deal **4** hits of damage back to the player, for **30%** average damage per hit.

## Area of Effect

### ![Detonate](https://runescape.wiki/images/Detonate.png?8bcb0) Detonate

Detonate is classed as a channelled ability, but it is more of a *charge up* and then *release*. Pressing the ability will start **charging**, and then using the ability a **2nd** time will **release** the damage. You are **unable to move** while charging, but you can do other actions such as swapping weapons or using food.

When used, your character crouches down, increasing your hit by **50%** average damage per tick of charging, up to a maximum charge time of **3s** and a maximum damage of **250%**. This ability has a **30s** cooldown.

The **% charge** can be viewed on the buff bar, ranging from 0% to 100%. If released before 100% charge, the damage will cover a **3x3** area. If released at 100% charge, that area will be a **5x5**. The centre of this area will be your primary target.

## Stuns

### ![Deep Impact](https://runescape.wiki/images/Deep_Impact.png?3d084) Deep Impact

Deep Impact is a low damaging threshold, with a **15s** cooldown. When cast this deals **130%** average damage and will also **stun and bind** the target for **3.6s**.
