title: Magic Basic Abilities
description: Adrenaline-generating magic abilities for your rotation
---

Magic has fewer basics than Melee, but more than Necromancy, for a nice middle ground. Magic and Range have quite a few **similar basics** that perform the same, so this can help with familiarity.

All of these Magic Basic Abilities will generate a base of **8% adrenaline**.

## Conditional Damage

### ![Wrack](https://runescape.wiki/images/Wrack.png?1e65a) Wrack

## Channelled Abilities

### ![Concentrated Blast](https://runescape.wiki/images/Concentrated_Blast.png?ac732) Concentrated Blast

This is the only **channelled** Magic basic, dealing **3** hits over **3.0s**. These hits deal progressively more damage: **50%**, **55%** and **60%**, totalling **165%**.

Each hit also increases your **Critical Strike Chance** of your next magic attack by **5%**. This means that the 2nd hit will have a 5% increased chance, the 3rd 10%, and the first hit of your next magic ability 15%.

It is worth noting that you may want to stop this ability from **fully channelling** by using your next ability as soon as possible, dealing only the first 2 hits. This ability has a short cooldown of **5.4s** that is shared with **Sonic Wave**.

> This ability can be upgraded to ![Greater Concentrated Blast](https://runescape.wiki/images/Greater_Concentrated_Blast.png?445f0) **Greater Concentrated Blast** via an ability codex. This increases the total damage from **165%** to **168%** and compresses the 3 hits into **1.8s**.
