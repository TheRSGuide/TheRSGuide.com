**Magic** is one of the **3 core styles**, thus following the general concept of **Basic**, **Threshold** and **Ultimate Abilities**. It is a very balanced style when it comes to damage output, damage mitigation, and overall ease of use.

Magic has quite a few abilities, but fewer than **Melee**. You will also find that **Magic** and **Ranged** share many abilities that are similar in damage and effect.
