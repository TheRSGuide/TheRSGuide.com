description: Desert quest finale unlocking Amascut boss fight
---

Completing **Eclipse of the Heart** is the finale of the entire **Desert quest series**, tying together years of storylines and adventures in the Kharidian Desert. As a reward, you will receive **1,000,000 experience** in the form of prismatic lamps, which can be used on any skill above level 85, making this quest a significant boost for late-game skill training.

Most importantly, this quest unlocks the boss **Amascut, the Devourer**. Defeating Amascut offers several best-in-slot rewards: a Necromancy main hand weapon and nexus, Magic power armour, and a Melee halberd. These unique boss drops make Eclipse of the Heart a major milestone for PvM progression and is highly recommended for players seeking to maximize combat potential across all styles.
