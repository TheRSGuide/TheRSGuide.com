title: Zuk Cape
description: Best-in-slot capes from the TzKal-Zuk encounter
---

**Zuk Cape** boosts a number of ultimate abilities and provides a large combat stat boost. You will have to fight your way through progressively harder, wave-based combat encounters in the TzHaar city to unlock this cape.

The first step is to complete the **TzHaar Fight Cave** to obtain the **Fire Cape**. The Fight Cave can be completed at a relatively low level and is required to access the next encounter.

**The Elder Kiln** quest unlocks the **Fight Kiln** which rewards you with a style-specific stat boosting cape, the **Kiln Cape**. You can earn a certain style by dealing the most damage with that combat style during the fight. The Fight Kiln can be completed comfortably at mid game levels and does not require Curses or Overloads.

The **Zuk Cape** is an upgrade to the Kiln Cape. Completing a full run of the **TzKal-Zuk** encounter rewards you with an **Igneous Stone**, used to upgrade any Kiln Cape into its corresponding style-specific Zuk Cape. Unlike OSRS, this fight in RS3 is less extreme in terms of difficulty and can be done as an entry to the endgame.

You can combine all 4 Zuk Capes into a single cape by completing the *Excuse Me, That's My Seat* achievement, which requires the player to defeat TzKal-Zuk in Hard Mode without failing any of his challenges or resetting along the way.
