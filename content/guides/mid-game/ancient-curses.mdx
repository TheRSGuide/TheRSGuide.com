description: Unlock the powerful Ancient Curses prayer book
---

Ancient Curses are an alternate prayer book unlocked after **The Temple at Senntisten** quest. The book has similar prayers to the default book, but the prayers are more powerful and have extra effects. Here is an overview of the most commonly used curses in combat:

**Deflect Curses**: These curses act as standard protection prayers, but also deflect a bit of damage back to your enemy. They are used anywhere you would use a normal protection prayer.

**Soul Split**: This curse heals you for 10% of damage dealt to an enemy, and is very useful for both bossing and Slayer.

**T95 Curses**: These curses are your strongest stat-boosting curses available in the book without any additional unlock requirements. They add +10 attack levels to boost accuracy, +10 defence levels to boost your armour, and give you 10% more damage.

**T99 Curses**: These curses are more powerful than the previous, but are unlocked via a Praesul Codex dropped from Nex: Angel of Death. They provide a +12 boost to attack and accuracy as well as 12% more damage.
