description: The elite skill that enhances your gear with powerful perks
---

Invention is a skill that provides useful bonuses and items to almost every aspect of the game. It is classified as an elite skill, and thus requires level 80 **Crafting**, **Divination**, and **Smithing** to access.

## Requirements

| Skill | Level |
|-------|-------|
| Smithing | 80 |
| Crafting | 80 |
| Divination | 80 |

## How It's Trained

Invention is mainly trained by augmenting combat gear or skilling tools and levelling them up through regular use. The gear is then siphoned or disassembled for Invention XP. You can also create items to gain XP, though it is not as quick.

## Gizmos & Perks

As mentioned above, Invention grants you the ability to augment certain gear. You can add effects to your gear by creating **perks** with gizmos. Available perks range from useful combat or skilling effects to flat-out damage boosting effects. Adding powerful perks to your gear can greatly aid in combat or skilling.

## Why Invention?

Combat benefits provided by perks should not be understated. Even with inexpensive entry-level perks, you can easily add **upwards of 6%** increased damage output when engaging in combat.

Skilling perks can make your training faster, provide extra resources, or even provide an XP boost.
