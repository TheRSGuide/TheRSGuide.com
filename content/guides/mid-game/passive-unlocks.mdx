Passive unlocks are powerful items or effects that provide ongoing benefits without requiring active use each time. They help automate repetitive tasks, boost experience gains, and improve overall efficiency in combat and skilling.

## Requirements

| Skill | Level |
|-------|-------|
| Dungeoneering | 70 |

## Key Passive Unlocks

### Charming Imp
This Dungeoneering reward can be stored in your inventory or pocket slot. It automatically collects summoning charms dropped by monsters, saving you significant time and inventory space during Slayer and combat training.

### Bonecrusher
Another Dungeoneering reward, the Bonecrusher automatically crushes bones dropped by monsters, granting you Prayer experience instantly. This is especially useful for Slayer tasks and general combat, as it passively trains Prayer without needing to pick up or bury bones manually.

### Ring of Vigour
Once unlocked, this ring can be worn or its effect can be permanently unlocked later in the game. It reduces the adrenaline cost of ultimate abilities by 10%, allowing for more frequent use of powerful attacks. This is a key upgrade for improving combat efficiency and is highly recommended for all combat styles.
