Player-owned Ports are one of the **longest** time-gated activities in RuneScape, often taking several months to fully complete.

## Requirements

You need level 90 in any of these skills to start:
- Hunter
- Thieving

## Why Start Early?

Starting Ports as early as possible gives you a significant head start on acquiring unique rewards. Completing voyages unlocks rare **Invention** materials, which are essential for crafting:

Progressing through Ports is a key step for players aiming to maximize their account's potential in both combat and skilling.
