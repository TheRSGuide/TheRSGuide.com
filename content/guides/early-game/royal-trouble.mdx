title: Royal Trouble
description: Upgrade Managing Miscellania for passive resource gathering
---

Completing **Royal Trouble** significantly upgrades your access to the **Managing Miscellania** resource management minigame.

After finishing the quest, you can assign more workers and increase your daily resource yield, providing a steady supply of valuable items such as **herbs**, **seeds**, **bird's nests** (which contain tree seeds and rings), and **maple logs**. These resources are crucial for training **Herblore**, **Farming**, and **Invention** (as maple logs are a reliable source of simple parts for disassembly).

The passive nature of Managing Miscellania makes it one of the most efficient and low-effort ways to gather important supplies for skilling progression throughout your account's journey.
