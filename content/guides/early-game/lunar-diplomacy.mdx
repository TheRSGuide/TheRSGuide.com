title: Lunar Diplomacy
description: Unlock the Lunar spellbook with powerful utility spells
---

Completing Lunar Diplomacy unlocks the **Lunar spellbook**, which offers powerful utility and skilling spells like **Plank Make**, **Superglass Make**, and **Spellbook Swap**. These spells are useful for both skilling efficiency and flexible magic use.

You'll also gain access to the **Astral Altar** on Lunar Isle, allowing you to craft **Astral runes** — essential for casting Lunar spells.

**Lunar Diplomacy** is also a requirement for the midgame quest [While Guthix Sleeps](/guides/mid-game/while-guthix-sleeps), which is one of the mid game goals later on in our guide.
