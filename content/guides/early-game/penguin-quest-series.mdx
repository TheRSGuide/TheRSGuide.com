title: Penguin Quest Series
description: Unlock the strongest weekly D&D for free experience
---

Penguins Hide and Seek is considered the strongest weekly Distraction and Diversion (D&D) for Ironman accounts, as it can provide upwards of 500,000 experience per month in skill lamps at mid to high levels.

Completing the Penguin series is not required for Penguin Hide and Seek, but each quest in the series unlocks additional penguin spies to find each week, allowing you to earn more points and claim even more experience. Progressing through the series is a useful long-term investment to maximize your weekly rewards.
