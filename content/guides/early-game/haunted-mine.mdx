title: Haunted Mine
description: Unlock the Salve Amulet for massive bonuses against undead
---

Completing the Haunted Mine quest allows you to craft a **Salve amulet**, which provides a significant **15% boost to both damage and accuracy** against undead monsters. By enchanting it into a **Salve amulet (e)**, this boost increases to **20%**.

This amulet is highly valuable for both early and late-game content, as many powerful bosses and training spots feature undead enemies. The Salve amulet's bonuses stack with most other damage-boosting effects, making it a staple for maximizing your efficiency in combat training and high-level PvM encounters.

If you plan to train your combat skills on undead creatures, or take on endgame bosses like **Rasial** or **Vorkath**, the Salve amulet is an essential upgrade that will noticeably speed up your progress.
