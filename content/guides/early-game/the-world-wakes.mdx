description: Unlock Sunshine and Death's Swiftness ultimate abilities
---

Completing The World Wakes will reward you with 450,000 experience in lamps (usable on most skills, with some level restrictions), plus lamps for 110,000 Slayer XP and 250,000 Prayer XP. If you don't meet the skill requirements for the lamps, you can destroy and reclaim them later.

Additionally, you will unlock the **Sunshine** (Magic) and **Death's Swiftness** (Ranged) ultimate abilities, which are necessary for high-level PvM and bossing.

> **Note:** There are no formal skill or quest requirements to start The World Wakes, but the quest includes several tough combat encounters. Bring strong food, potions, and good gear, and be ready for multi-phase boss fights.
