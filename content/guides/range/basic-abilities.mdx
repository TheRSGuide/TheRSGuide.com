title: Ranged Basic Abilities
description: Adrenaline-generating ranged abilities for your rotation
---

Ranged has fewer basics than Melee, but more than Necromancy, for a nice middle ground. Ranged and Magic have quite a few **similar basics** that perform the same, so this can help with familiarity. There are also some abilities that perform similar to Melee, but significantly less.

All of these Ranged Basic Abilities will generate a base of **8% adrenaline**.
