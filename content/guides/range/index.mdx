**Ranged** is one of the **3 core styles**, thus following the general concept of **Basic**, **Threshold** and **Ultimate Abilities**. This style can deal very large amounts of damage, but lacks in the ease of use and the utility department.

Ranged has quite a few abilities, but fewer than **Melee**. You will also find that **Ranged** and **Magic** share many abilities that are similar in damage and effect.
