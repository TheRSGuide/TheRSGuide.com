This is an ironman and main account gear recommender! Input your username to get a recommendation on what armor and weapons to aim for as your next upgrade! While this gear recommender can be used for bossing, the primary focus is for training your combat skills until level 95.

Some gear options are omitted both due to high cost for limited benefit, or difficulty to obtain on Ironman.

## General Gear Progression

### Early Game (Levels 1-50)

For early game, focus on obtaining gear that matches your current skill levels. Power armour provides damage bonuses but less defensive stats, while tank armour provides more defence but no damage bonus.

| Combat Style | Weapon Tier | Armour Tier |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Magic | Staff/Wand + Orb | Mystic/Lunar |
| Ranged | Shortbow/Crossbows | Dragonhide |
| Melee | Scimitar/Longsword | Rune/Dragon |
| Necromancy | Death Guard | First Necromancer's Robes |

### Mid Game (Levels 50-80)

At this stage, you should be working towards tier 70+ gear which unlocks some of the best training options.

| Combat Style | Recommended Weapons | Recommended Armour |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Magic | Staff of Light, Ahrim's | Subjugation, Ahrim's |
| Ranged | Hand Cannons, Karil's | Armadyl, Karil's |
| Melee | Abyssal Whip, Bandos Godsword | Bandos, Barrows |
| Necromancy | Tier 70 Death Guard | Deathdealer Robes |

### Late Game (Levels 80-99)

Late game gear focuses on maximizing DPS with tier 90+ weapons and power armour.

**Tier 90 Options:**
- Magic: Seismic Wand + Singularity, Noxious Staff
- Ranged: Ascension Crossbows, Noxious Longbow
- Melee: Drygore Weapons, Noxious Scythe
- Necromancy: Tier 90+ Death Guards

**Tier 92+ Options:**
- Consider Elite Dungeon weapons, Masterwork equipment, and boss drops

## Key Tips

1. **Accuracy matters** - Higher tier weapons provide better accuracy, which can be more important than damage in some cases
2. **Augment when possible** - Once you unlock [Invention](/guides/mid-game/invention), augmenting gear allows for perks that significantly boost your damage
3. **Don't skip tiers** - It's often better to get a full set of lower tier gear than partial higher tier
4. **Power vs Tank** - For training, power armour is generally preferred for faster kills
