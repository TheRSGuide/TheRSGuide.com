# JSX Components in MDX

## Why JSX?

You might notice that some pages contain code that looks like HTML but uses angle brackets with component names (like `<Cards>` or `<Card>`). This is JSX (JavaScript XML), and it allows us to embed interactive React components directly in our Markdown content.

JSX components allow us to:

- Create interactive elements that wouldn't be possible with plain Markdown
- Maintain consistent styling and layout across the site
- Build reusable components that can be used throughout the guide
- Add functionality like navigation cards, code examples, and more

Don't worry if you're not familiar with JSX - you can contribute great content using just Markdown! The JSX components are provided for specific use cases, and you can always ask in an issue if you're unsure how to use them.

## Common Components

For detailed information about available components and how to use them, see our [components guide](components.md).

> [!TIP]
> Want to explore and test JSX components? Visit our [online editor](https://editor.thersguide.com) which includes the full component library, allowing you to experiment with components and see live previews of your MDX content.

> [!NOTE]
> At this time, we do not accept contributions that include custom JSX components that do not already exist in our component library. Please use only the components documented in the [components guide](components.md), or use plain Markdown for your content. If you need a component that doesn't exist, please open an issue to discuss it first.
