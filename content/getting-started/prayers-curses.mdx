title: Prayers & Curses
description: Using prayers and curses to enhance combat effectiveness
---

Prayer is a vital part of combat but also includes utility and skilling effects.

Prayer points are the **currency** for using prayers. When turning prayers on, your prayer points will drain over time. Each prayer will drain prayer points by a different amount, and having multiple prayers active at once will sum those amounts. You can replenish your prayer points by drinking potions such as a **Prayer potion**, or by visiting and using an altar.

As your prayer skill level increases, the amount of prayers you have access to will increase, as well as your maximum prayer points.

## Prayer Books

There are **two prayer books**: the standard prayer book and the ancient curses book.

The standard prayer book is unlocked automatically, whilst the ancient curses book is unlocked by completing **The Temple of Senntisten** quest. Additional **Seren** curses can be unlocked and added to this book via completion of **The Light Within**.

## Standard Prayer Book

## Ancient Curses Book

### Deflect Curses

Similar to the standard prayer book, there are 4 prayers that reduce damage taken from that style by **50%**, but also can **deflect** some incoming damage back to the target.

| Curse | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| ![Deflect Magic](https://www.thersguide.com/1757006564570-Deflect_Magic.webp) Deflect Magic | 50% Magic damage reduction + reflect |

| ![Deflect Necromancy](https://www.thersguide.com/1757006564575-Deflect_Necromancy.webp) Deflect Necromancy | 50% Necromancy damage reduction + reflect |

### Soul Split

At a much higher prayer level, exists Soul Split. This is one of the most powerful prayers in the game, as it heals you for **10%** of the damage dealt, although this does have diminishing returns the higher the damage dealt.

This spell cannot be used at the same time as a deflect prayer.

### Turmoil-tier Curses

Our next 4 prayers are the most commonly used **damage boosting** prayers, with a prayer for each style. Each of these prayers increases your **accuracy, damage and defence**. The accuracy increase is **+10** levels, the damage increase is **+10%** and the defence increase is **+10** levels.

These prayers also include a **stat drain** on your target, primarily used to drain their defence level for slightly higher accuracy, however some bosses are immune to this.

| Curse | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| ![Turmoil](https://www.thersguide.com/1757006564483-Turmoil.webp) Turmoil | +10 accuracy, +10% damage, +10 defence (Melee) |
| ![Anguish](https://www.thersguide.com/1757006564487-Anguish.webp) Anguish | +10 accuracy, +10% damage, +10 defence (Ranged) |
| ![Torment](https://www.thersguide.com/1757006564485-Torment.webp) Torment | +10 accuracy, +10% damage, +10 defence (Magic) |
| ![Sorrow](https://www.thersguide.com/1757006564496-60px-Sorrow.webp) Sorrow | +10 accuracy, +10% damage, +10 defence (Necromancy) |

### Level 99 Curses

The final 4 damage boosting prayers are very similar to our previous 4, but just a little bit stronger. These now include a **+12** level accuracy boost, **+12%** damage boost and **+12** defence levels boost, while also retaining a very similar stat drain effect. These prayers require a **codex** to unlock as well as **99** prayer.

| Curse | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| ![Malevolence](https://www.thersguide.com/1757006564554-Malevolence.webp) Malevolence | +12 accuracy, +12% damage, +12 defence (Melee) |
