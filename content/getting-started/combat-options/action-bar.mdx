### Allow ability queueing

This setting is personal preference. When toggled on, it will queue a pressed ability until it goes off. When toggled off, you will need to press the ability the tick before wanting to cast it. If you spam keybinds, it is recommended to keep ability queueing off. The majority of players don't use ability queueing.

### Automatically trigger regenerate

Regenerate is an ability that can only be activated out of combat. When cast, it will consume your remaining adrenaline and convert it into lifepoints. This ability can be activated from the constitution book, or by clicking the heart icon next to your lifepoints. It is recommended to turn the automatic trigger setting off, and if you wish to use the ability, manually activate it.

### Allow incoming share offers

If you right click the cog on the right side of the primary action bar, you can share an action bar with friends. This setting can be toggled on or off to allow share offers.

### Display additional action bars

By default you will have 1 primary action bar and you can display up to an extra 4 action bars on screen. Add these to your screen as needed.

### Change action bar preset names

It is recommended to name your bars so you can easily find them when changing bars or adding additional action bars to your screen.
