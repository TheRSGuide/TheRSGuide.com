description: Configure how to attack targets in RuneScape

This section allows you to choose how to attack targets. Player attack option is up to your discretion, but generally right click is preferred for safety. NPC attack option should be set to left click. Hide familiar options and Hide duel option should both be selected, reducing accidental missclicks.
