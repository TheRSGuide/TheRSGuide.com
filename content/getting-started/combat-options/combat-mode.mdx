*Full Manual/Revolution/Legacy*

This is where you can select the type of ability usage you wish to use.

<SplitContent>
  <SplitItem width={60}>
Full Manual requires you to manually cast all abilities. Revolution uses the ability system but with some assistance. Legacy mode is the 'old' auto attack system. Although this may be familiar to most players, it should be avoided as the modern game is tailored towards using abilities.

## Full Manual Combat

*Auto attack*

This toggles whether the Necromancy basic attack will be auto cast if no other ability is pressed. Most newer players will want this toggled on. This is ONLY for the necromancy style.

---

## Revolution Combat

Revolution is a system that will automatically cast abilities in the order they are placed on your action bar. The effects and damage are the same as if you were on Full Manual, but will not require you to manually press abilities.

*Revolution size*

Set this to the amount of abilities you wish to be available for revolution to cast, generally encompass the majority of the abilities on your bar.

*Automatically trigger basic/threshold/ultimate*

As a recommendation, basic abilities should be set to automatically trigger, with thresholds and ultimates unticked. Letting the game cast your basic abilities and manually casting your threshold and ultimate abilities as you see fit is a great way to learn and progress through the game without having to get too involved. Thresholds and ultimates can be toggled on for a much more relaxing experience, such as AFK slayer, but is not advised for active bossing.

## Magic

*Auto-select magic spell*

It is recommended to keep this off, as it can cause negative effects if the incorrect spell is automatically selected. Spells can be manually selected by clicking the spell in the magic book (and selecting 'set main hand and offhand' if requested).

## Summoning

*Familiar combat mode*

This determines how your familiar will act when presented with combat encounters. "Attack same target" is advised for most scenarios.
