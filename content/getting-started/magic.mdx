description: Overview of Magic
---
Magic is a jack of all trades combat style, blending powerful damaging spells with defensive aspects that make tanking and soaking damage a breeze. It is comprised of fewer abilities, making rotations simpler than Ranged and Melee.

Outside of Necromancy, Magic is the next easiest combat style to master and has significant late game power.
