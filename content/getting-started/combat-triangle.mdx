## Weakness

Weakness is one of the easiest ways to increase your damage output. This can be achieved by using a specific class like **Ranged** & **Melee**, or a specific weakness like **Slash Weapons** or **Earth Spells**.

With that being said, because the maximum hit damage potential you can have is 100%, if you have 100% hit chance without using the target specific weakness, using the target's weakness will have **no** impact on your damage.
