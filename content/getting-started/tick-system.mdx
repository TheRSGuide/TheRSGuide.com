title: The Tick System
description: Understanding RuneScape's 0.6 second tick system

## How Does the World Work?

The game runs on what we call **ticks**, or **cycles**. Every **0.6** seconds, information is sent between you and RuneScape's servers, keeping your character up to date on what you're doing.

> Damage Ticks & Ability Cooldowns work off of the tick system

This is the core of understanding RuneScape, from your early levels all the way to the end game. Whether you're catching a fish, or trying to dodge an attack at a boss, you'll be constantly interacting with these **0.6** second intervals.

## The Global Cooldown

When using abilities it's worth getting used to the **Action Bar**. This has a global cooldown of **1.8s**. This means you can conventionally cast a new ability every **1.8s**, and abilities will spin around during this time.

Because of the **0.6s** tick system, this means that a GCD (Global Cooldown) consists of **3 ticks**. If you are manually using abilities, aim to press your next ability in the **green** section of the ability icon when it's almost finished cooling down.

## Reducing Input Delay

In addition, some players find there is significant delay in their inputs. While this is not directly related to the **Tick system**, we recommend the following settings to ensure smooth, responsive gameplay:

- Play on a server that is geographically close to your location
- When performing high input activities such as Combat, play on a world with **under 200** players
