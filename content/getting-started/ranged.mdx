title: Ranged
description: Overview of Ranged
---
Ranged is a feast or famine combat style with limited early game power but significant late game upgrades that result in the most damage output of any combat style. Buyer beware though, as executing high level ranged rotations is a complicated endeavour.

In addition, Ranged underperforms compared to all other styles in the early and mid game.
