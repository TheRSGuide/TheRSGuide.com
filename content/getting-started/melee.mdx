description: Overview of Melee
---
Melee is a classic combat style with a large variety of powerful abilities. However, high damage comes with high risk, as you use the Berserk ultimate ability which increases both your damage dealt and damage taken.

It's relatively easy to train, but mechanically complex in boss encounters as melee has the most total abilities of every style in RuneScape.
