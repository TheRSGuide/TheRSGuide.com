title: Necromancy Combat
description: Overview of Necromancy combat style in RuneScape
---

Necromancy is RuneScape's newest combat style, designed specifically for newer players to be more intuitive, more tutorialized, and more powerful than the other styles in the early and mid game.

It involves both traditional abilities to deal damage as well as powerful undead conjures which deal damage, provide damage reduction, and provide healing.

Because of this, **Necromancy is recommended for newer players** as a means to ease into the combat system and fast-track to the late game.

## Combat Style Analysis
