description: Taking Advantage of the RuneScape Wiki
---

RuneScape has one of the best wikis ever made, created by a passionate and community-driven playerbase. The Wiki includes many **tips, tutorials, progression pathways**, and information on every single **monster, quest, and item** in RuneScape.

As an extra - there's both a wiki button in game next to your chat bar that can be clicked to directly search the wiki - and for those who would rather use the standard ingame chat, you can type **/wiki [search]** to open a wiki page in your browser.

There are plenty of other community resources worth checking out that will crop up later in this guide.
