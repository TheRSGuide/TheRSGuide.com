## New Players

If this is your first time creating a RuneScape account to access the world of Gielinor, you will need to start by **downloading the official game client** and creating an account through the **Jagex Launcher**.

Once you have created your account and verified your email address, you will be asked to create a Jagex Account Name. This is **different** from your character name and is used for communication from Jagex.

> Jagex will use your Jagex Account Name when contacting you about your account. Your RuneScape or Old School character names will not be used.

Once you're on the client, you can click **New Character** to start your adventure!

## OSRS Players

If you are an existing OSRS player who is already on the Jagex Launcher, you can access the official RS client by clicking the **RuneScape** button in the top left corner of the launcher and selecting your desired character. No additional steps are required!

{/* If you are an OSRS player who does not yet have a Jagex account, we **recommend** moving your existing characters to a **Jagex account**.

However, you can still access Runescape without a Jagex account by downloading the official RS client directly from the website and logging in with your *existing* OSRS credentials. */}
