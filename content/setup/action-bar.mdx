The action bar is the home of **Abilities**, and has four icons that you should familiarize yourself with. From left to right, they are as follows:

| Icon | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| ![Empty Action Bar](https://www.thersguide.com/images/gui/health.png) | Lifepoints | Shows your current and maximum lifepoints. Try to keep it above 0. |
| ![Empty Action Bar](https://www.thersguide.com/images/gui/adrenalinev2.png) | Adrenaline | Adrenaline is the currency that you build and spend in combat. Powerful ultimate abilities require 100% adrenaline to use, while basic abilities will generate adrenaline. When outside of combat, adrenaline drains to 0 by default. Clicking on this icon will toggle **Auto-Retaliate Mode**, which will make your character automatically fight back when provoked in combat. |
| ![Empty Action Bar](https://www.thersguide.com/images/gui/prayer-points.png) | Prayer Points | Shows your current and maximum prayer points. Right clicking the icon allows you to set up **Quick Prayers**. These can be turned on either via a keybind, or by left clicking on the prayer icon. |
| ![Empty Action Bar](https://www.thersguide.com/images/gui/summoning-points.png) | Summoning Points | Shows your current and maximum summoning points. Right clicking on the icon will provide a list of useful options such as using a special move scroll, accessing a familiar inventory, or calling your familiar to your location. One of these options can be configured as a left click. |
