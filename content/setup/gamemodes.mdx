import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

Before you first enter the game world, you have an important decision to make: **selecting a gamemode!**

This decision is in most cases **irreversible**, although you can _downgrade_ an ironman account into a group ironman, and downgrade from there to a main account if you change your mind later.

{/* ![Game Mode Selection Screen](https://www.thersguide.com/images/gui/chosegamemode.jpg) */}

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Standard Account (None)">
    This is your standard account, which means you have no limitations. You are able to trade other players, access the **Grand Exchange**, and purchase bonds to speed up your progression!

    > Commonly referred to as a "main" account

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ironman">
    This gamemode means you stand alone (kind of). You are **not** able to trade with other players or access the Grand Exchange, but you **can** engage in group activities with main accounts and other Ironman accounts.

    If you choose to play as an Ironman, you will be given the option to select between **Regular** or **Hardcore** mode.

    {/* ![Ironman Selection Screen](https://www.thersguide.com/images/gui/ironmanselection.jpg) */}

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hardcore Ironman (HCIM)">
    This gamemode has the same restrictions as an Ironman account but takes them a step further. As a Hardcode Ironman, you have a maximum of **three lives** before losing Hardcore status. Once you lose your last life, you will become a normal Ironman account.

    > While accounts default to 1 life, 2 extra lives can be purchased from Mr. Ex in Edgeville at 1000 and 1600 total level.

  </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Non-Competitive Group Ironman (GIM)">

    Ironman mode, but with friends! Play together in a group of 2-5. While you can't trade with other players, you have a **Group Storage** that acts as a shared bank space, allowing you to work together and even share gear that is usually untradeable!

    If you choose to play as a Group Ironman, you will be placed at the **Iron Enclave** after completing Tutorial Island.

    From here, you will be asked to select which ruleset you would like to follow: **Regular** (non-competitive) or **Competitive**.

    {/* ![Ironman Mode Selection Screen](https://www.thersguide.com/images/gui/selectironmanmode.jpg) */}

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Competitive Group Ironman (CGIM)">
   The same as Non-Competitive Group Ironman, but with additional restrictions for your group.

    Be wary though; in Competitive Group Ironman you can **only** fight bosses and complete activities with those in your group - outside help is not allowed!
