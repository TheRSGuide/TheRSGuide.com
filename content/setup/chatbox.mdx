## The Chatbox

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>

</div>
The chat interface is where you type messages to the world, your friends, your clan, or your group.

This interface looks **slightly** different depending on if you're using the Modern or the Legacy interface skin, but it is functionally identical.

## Chat Troubleshooting
In Legacy interface mode, **"always on"** chat is on by default. This prevents you from being able to use abilities. It can be toggled off by clicking on the cog wheel and switching **"always on mode"** to **off**.
