## The World Map
The world map is one of the most helpful tools in your toolkit! It allows you to quickly find, mark, and navigate to any location in Gielinor. You can zoom, click, drag, or search the map to get a better understanding of your surroundings.

## Lodestone Network

  <SplitItem width={60}>
    Lodestones can be used to quickly navigate around Gielinor. These can be unlocked by clicking on lodestones you encounter around the game world. Some areas may have quest requirements to access. These cannot be used in combat, but require no runes and have no cooldown.

## High Contrast Mode
<SplitContent>
<SplitItem width={50}>High contrast mode is an accessibility feature which can be toggled on or off at any time. It is especially useful to help distinguish between object types in cluttered areas. By default, some entity types share the same highlight colour. If you would like more distinction, you can change the highlight parameters of each object type in the **Accessibility Settings** tab</SplitItem>
