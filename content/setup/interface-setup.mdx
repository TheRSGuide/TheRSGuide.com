Setting up your RuneScape interface is easy:

By default, you'll start your adventure in what's known as Classic Mode This is a standard, resizable interface that is perfect for beginners and has a lot of good features, in convenient places. If you're an Old School RuneScape player, you'll see many components like the inventory tabs, chatbox, and minimap that may be familiar to you. 

{/* TODO: Add image of "Classic Interface" from Fixes channel */}

While the Classic mode is the perfect starting point, later on in your journey you may want to build a custom interface that is perfectly catered to your needs. 

RuneScape has interface sharing, which has made this process significantly easier. In just a few steps you can instantly import a community-recommended interface layout, saving a ton of time and effort!
