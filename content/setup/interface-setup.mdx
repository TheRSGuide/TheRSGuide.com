Setting up your RuneScape interface used to be one of the most challenging tasks for new and returning players. In the past, customizing your interface to match optimal setups required you to manually move every window and panel, often by following guides or videos.

This is no longer the case, a recent update introduced **interface sharing**, which has made this process significantly easier! Now, with just a few steps, you can instantly import a highly efficient interface layout recommended by the community, so you can start playing without all the hassle.

## Interface Setup Guide
<Card>
1. Press Escape
2. Click "Edit Layout Mode"
3. In the "Load From A Player" box, type "rs interface"
4. Select "Custom 1" if your resolution is 1080p
5. Select "Custom 2" if your resolution is 1440p
6. Under "Save Layout" use the dropdown to select "Custom 1"
7. Click "Save"
8. Click "Save and Exit"
</Card>

Once you've followed the above steps, your interface should look something similar to this:

<SplitContent>
  <SplitItem width={50}>
    **1080p (1920x1080)**
    ![1080p Interface Layout](https://www.thersguide.com/images/interface/1080pinterface.png)
  </SplitItem>
  <SplitItem width={50}>
    **1440p (2560x1440)**
    ![1440p Interface Layout](https://www.thersguide.com/images/interface/2kinterface.png)
  </SplitItem>
</SplitContent>

>You'll notice on the top left that a number of ability books are present and open. Once you've set up your action bars and begun to engage in combat, these can be freely closed.

## Legacy Interface Skin
If you prefer a legacy look to your UI, follow the steps below
<Card>
1. Press Escape
2. Type "Legacy" in the search bar
3. Toggle on "Legacy Interface Skin"
</Card>
> Note: There is also a Legacy Interface mode that can be toggled on, transforming your user interface to be similar to the OSRS layout and functionality. This is not recommended as it limits functionality for things like keybinds.
