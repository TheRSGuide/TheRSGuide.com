Jumping into a new game, let alone a new MMO, can be *daunting* - especially one as unique as **RuneScape**. RuneScape is a sandbox MMO and is about adventure, self-discovery and most importantly, forging your own path.

This website has been designed to give you **everything** you need to help you along the start of your adventure - settings, interfaces, general tips, and the best information sources that 'scapers everywhere have been using for years to have the best time in the world of Gielinor.

If you'd like to jump past the starter guide to [Introduction to Combat](/getting-started/combat-basics) or [Progression Path and account goals](/guides/early-game), click the links!
